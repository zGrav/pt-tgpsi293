Hi and thank you for downloading Codename Breeze!

This program is still in a development stage, so some features might be buggy and/or missing.

It's basically a Android controller that allows you to control your device via Keyboard/Mouse (if you're root) and view your 
device screen.

It can connect via USB cable and WiFi but needs ADB to do so.

For WiFi you must have a app that you can easily find on Market or CyanogenMod where you can just enable it on Settings->Developer Options
Working app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryosoftware.adbw&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5yeW9zb2Z0d2FyZS5hZGJ3Il0.

The requirements for this program to run are:
- Java
- Android SDK (for ADB)
- Eclipse (optional if you want to debug)
- Maven (native install)
- M2Eclipse (Maven - Eclipse plugin)
- XAMPP (if you want to run it as localhost for backoffice to work.)

The included folders are the project folders for Maven and Eclipse, I decided not to convert the Client folder to Eclipse because
you can export the client as a normal JAR file but you have to follow the steps that I left on a README inside the folder afterwards.

If you have any suggestions and encounter bugs (highly likely) please contact me at zgrav@null.net

If you also think that the external backoffice is going to hack you, the files are public at http://strikker.org/zgrav_pap
